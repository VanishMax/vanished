<h2>About me</h2>

<section>
  <p>
    I love front-end development with all my heart. Though just development can happen to be boring,
    I try to contribute to open-source, create my own projects and keep on learning new things.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a job, I interfere in business processes to create the most realistic and understandable
    requirements. The same is about design, I would rather participate in the prototyping process
    than fix UX bugs on later stages. I believe that websites can be easy-to-use, multi-cultural and
    fully accessible for people around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Establishing end-to-end testing along with TypeScript on a daily basis, I ensure
    that everything works as it should. But at the same time, I respect deadlines and try not to break them
    by doing my best.
